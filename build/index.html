          hello! my name is riley connors. i like to build cool things with
          computers—currently i have my hands in robotics projects (we're
          building a stewart platform for ocean-based platform simulation using
          ros2) and some modelling and simulation (modelling
          high-powered-microwaves for anti-drone defense). i am studying
          computer science at the university of missouri - kansas city (umkc),
          where i also work in a research lab as part of the missouri institute
          for defense and energy (hence the robots and the drones). i like to
          run (since you asked, i'm training for a marathon) and use parentheses
          whenever possible (though i have nothing but respect for em-dashes and
          semi-colons).<br />
          <br />i started off my career in the world of computers with, of
          course, a degree in philosophy. i knew it wasn't a get-hired-quick
          sort of degree, but hey, coming out of high school i wasn't
          particularly interested in figuring life out just yet. 3 years later, armed
          with arguably too much time spent thinking abstractly about problems
          nobody has, i decided to pivot into computer science. this didn't come
          out of nowhere—i had always enjoyed tinkering with computers as a
          kid, trying to get them to do things that weren't immediately
          obvious.<br />
          <br />i enrolled at umkc in the spring of '23, and am currently a year
          away from graduating with a bs in computer science. in the spring of
          '24 i started working in the previously mentioned missouri institute
          for defense and energy, a series of research labs at umkc doing work
          in a variety of fields but particularly anything to do with unmanned
          vehicles and rf.
